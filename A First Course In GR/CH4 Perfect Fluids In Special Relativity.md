### 4.1 Fluids

- The source of the gravitational field can be taken as a perfect fluid as a first approximation.
- A fluid is a special kind of continuum- a collection of particles so numerous that the dynamics of individual particles cannot be followed, leaving only a description in terms of average quantities-number of particles per unit volume, energy density, density of momentum, temperature etc.
- The collection of particles must be large enough so that individual particles dont matter, but small enough so that it is relatively homogenous- average velocity, kinetic energy, interparticle spacing must be the same everywhere in the collection. Such a collection is called an element.
- These elements are a large collection of particles having the same value of density, average velocity, and temperature. IF such a collection does not exist, then the continuum approximation breaks down
- A fluid is a continuum that flows. Rigidity comes from forces parallel to the interface between two elements. Two adjacent elements can push and pull on each other, but the continuum wont be rigid unless they prevent each other from sliding along their common boundary. A fluid is characterized by the weakness of such forces compared to the push and pull forces which are called pressure. A perfect fluid has all anti slipping forces equal to 0, the only force between neighboring elements being pressure.

### 4.2 Dust: The Number-flux vector $\vec{N}$ 

- Relativistic description of a fluid
- Dust is a collection of particles, all of which are at rest in some Lorentz frame.

*The Number Density $n$* 
- Basic question: how many of these particles are there per unit volume?
- In their rest frame, just count them and divide by volume for different regions.
$$n\equiv number\ density\ in\ the\ MCRF\ of\ the\ element$$
- $n$ may be a function of the coordinates $x^{i}$, but in the rest frame, it will not depend on $t$. In other frames, the Lorentz transformations may bring a dependence on $t'$.
- The number density in some frame $O'$:
- They will all have the same velocity $v$ in $O'$. Total number of particles will not change, however, the same number of particles might occupy a different volume.
- Suppose, in the rest frame, some number of particles occupied a volume $\Delta x \Delta y \Delta z$. In $O'$, due to Lorentz contraction, they will occupy a volume  $\Delta x \Delta y \Delta z \sqrt{1-v^2}$.
- Hence, the number density in this frame is related to the rest frame by $\frac{n}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}$ 

*The Flux across a surface*
- When particles move, another basic question is how many of them move in a specific direction?
- The flux of particles across a surface is the number crossing a unit area of that surface in a unit time.
- Since area and time are frame dependent concepts, the flux clearly depends on the inertial reference frame used. It also depends on the orientation of the surface, since a surface parallel to the velocity of the particles will have no particles crossing it.
- In the rest frame of the dust, the flux is 0.
- in $O'$, suppose all particles move with the velocity $v$ in the $x$ direction. Consider a surface $\mathcal{L}$ that is oriented perpendicular to $x'$ which has are $A=\Delta y \Delta z$. All the particles within a distance $v \Delta t$ will cross the surface in time $\Delta t'$. Since the particles are moving in the $x$-direction, the rectangular volume $\Delta y \Delta z v \Delta t'$ contains all and only those particles that will generate the flux. Hence, the total number of particles that will cross the surface is $\frac{n}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}\Delta y \Delta z v \Delta t'$.
- The flux (number crossing per unit volume per unit time) is then  $$(flux)^{x'}=\frac{nv}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}$$
- Suppose the particles also had a velocity in the y-direction. Then, in 2-D, the particles will hit the surface $\mathcal{L}$ diagonally, and the volume enclosing the particles that will hit the surface forms a triangle. In 3-D, this will be a parallelepiped (extending to outside the screen).
- ......
- $$(flux)^{x'}=\frac{nv^{x'}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}$$
