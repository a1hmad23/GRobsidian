# Theory of Problem

## Educational Inequity
*Definition*: When a segment of the population is denied the minimum level and quality of education that they would need to fulfill their potential as loving, thinking, and engaged adults.
- Inequity is not the same as inequality. Specifically, although it might be contingent on, but it is not the inequality of inputs but more so the equality of outputs. 
- It may or may not be materialistic in nature.
### Educational Inequity in Pakistan
- At least 23 Million children are out of school.
- At least 47% of all students in grade 5 cannot perform two-digit division, a task to be mastered by grade 2.
- Although the following statistics do not completely define the state of people's lives, or their personalities, they are good markers to indicate that everything could be a lot better in the (predictable) future for the kids mentioned above:
	- 6% of women and 11% of men aged 25 and above have at least a bachelors degree.
	- 98% of Pakistanis earn less than $6 per day, often in unsafe and exploitive conditions.

## Causes of Educational Inequity (in Pakistan)
The following are some general causes:
-  Education Politics and Policy
- Education Finance
- Teaching
- Household factors (early development, nutrition, safety,
  access to information and resources, family education etc.)
- Community level factors
- School Management/Edu Management
- Curriculum and textbooks
- Assessments
- Wider discourse/societal beliefs
- Social development politics and policy (health, poverty
  alleviation, water, sanitation, housing etc.)
Each of these factors is extremely complicated to holistically denote, with many other factors responsible for them and in turn many other factors responsible for those. As an example, consider teaching, for which some of the factors responsible for it being a factor for educational inequity are: ![[Teaching root cause analysis.png]]
The causes of educational inequity belong from almost all sectors of life. Moreover, upon a basic analysis, it is clear that most of these factors are interconnected in complex ways. Hence, educational inequity is a **Systemic Problem**.

The **Education System** comprises of individual institutions and stakeholder groups, and regulations and culture that guide decision-making and interactions among these actors.

# Vision: What do we want for the kids?

## Organizational Student Vision-Statement
Our vision is for our children to grow into scholars, thinkers, artists, scientists and entrepreneurs - builders of a new Pakistan. The day when all of Pakistan’s children participate in an education that nurtures their humanity and spurs their growth into the best possible versions of their whole selves, becoming the loving, thinking, and engaged people that Pakistan needs. 

When all children exist in the world with love and kindness in their hearts; towards themselves and
others - not contingent on kinships, religion, ethnicity or cast - but for the sake of the inherent value of being human.

When all children think critically and passionately about the lives they wish to lead and have the
freedom and ability to pursue what matters most to them. When all children know that life can be hard but full of possibilities; when they are able to pick themselves up after a fall, live with courage and not fear and are able to be the best versions of themselves.

When all children belong; with pride for where they come from, they cherish being a part of and
shaping a larger collective. They exist in the world with civic and social values of our shared humanity.

# Theory of Change

**How do we get to the alternate future that we envision?**

![[Theory of Change.png]]
lets focus on the Student Leaders part. We will achieve this via changing student outcomes such that our students have the following qualities:
![[Student Outcomes.png]]

As for the Alumni, we want
- I understand how inequity is embedded and perpetuated in Pakistan’s social,
  economic, political, cultural systems.
- I know my values, relationship with power and privilege, perspectives and biases, and
  continually reflect critically on all of these so I can grow.
- I have an ambitious, personal vision for Pakistan, and work towards it with sustained
  passion and ownership.
- I understand the power of the collective, and know how to join forces with and draw
  in all those who share a vision for an alternate future for the children of Pakistan.
- I operate with courage and resilience; taking risks that others will not, with hope, and
  with the understanding that the work of system-change requires persistence,
  innovation, loss and time.
