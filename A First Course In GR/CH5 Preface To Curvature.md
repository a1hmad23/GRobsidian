#### 5.1 On The Relation Of Gravitation To Curvature

- Until now, forces have been ignored, which is the case in SR.
- In SR, inertial frames fill all of spacetime, thus all of spacetime can be described by a single frame, whose coordinate points are all at rest, and whose clocks all run at the same rate relative to the origin's clock.
- The fundamental postulates led to the concept of the interval, which gives invariant geometrical meaning to certain physical statements: a timelike interval between two events is the time elapsed by a clock going through those events, while a spacelike interval is the length of the rod between two events in a frame where the two events are simultaneous.
- The mathematical function that calculates the interval is the metric, so the metric of SR is defined physically by leng
