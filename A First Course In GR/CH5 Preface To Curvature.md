#### 5.1 On The Relation Of Gravitation To Curvature

- Until now, forces have been ignored, which is the case in SR.
- In SR, inertial frames fill all of spacetime, thus all of spacetime can be described by a single frame, whose coordinate points are all at rest, and whose clocks all run at the same rate relative to the origin's clock.
- The fundamental postulates led to the concept of the interval, which gives invariant geometrical meaning to certain physical statements: a timelike interval between two events is the time elapsed by a clock going through those events, while a spacelike interval is the length of the rod between two events in a frame where the two events are simultaneous.
- The mathematical function that calculates the interval is the metric, so the metric of SR is defined physically by lengths of rods and readings of clocks.
- We could define other metrics too, but unless they correspond to a physical scenario, they would be useless. The one we have chosen does, in that it provides readings of clocks and lengths of rods, and so can be experimentally tested.
- Is it possible to construct a frame in which the clocks all run at the same rate? In non uniform gravitational fields, the answer is no. So gravitation incompatible with global SR. However, in small regions of spacetime- regions small enough that the non uniformities of the gravitational field are too small to measure, it is always possible to construct local SR. So we have to build local SR into a more general theory. The first step is to proof that clocks don't run at the same rate in a gravitational field:

*The Gravitational Redshift Experiment*
- On Earth, a particle of mass m is dropped from a tower of height h, falling freely with acceleration g. Its total energy when it reaches the ground is $m+0.5mv^{2}= m+mgh$.
- Change all of this energy into a photon directed upwards. This does not violate conservation laws as the momentum is absorbed by the Earth while the energy by the photon. 
- When the photon reaches the top, convert its energy back to a mass. 
- Now, if the photon does not lose any energy, there is no reason to not have perpetual motion. So the photon most lose as much energy as the mass m gained, since if it lost any less, upon converting to a mass again, that mass would have gained energy and perpetual motion.
- Let E be the energy of the photon when it got converted to at the bottom and let E' be the energy when it converted at the top. Then, we have: $$\frac{E'}{E}=\frac{h \nu'}{h \nu}=\frac{m}{m+mgh}=1-gh$$
- Hence, we conclude that a photon climbing up Earths gravitational field will lose energy and be redshifted.

*Nonexistence Of A Lorentz Frame At Rest On Earth* 
- If SR is to be valid, lets assume that the laboratory frame at rest on Earth should be a Lorentz frame. Let the gravitational field be uniform and not changing with time. let a light wave travel upwards. The, the time difference between one crest reaching the top and another one should be equal to the time difference at the bottom. But, we know that the time difference is the reciprocal of frequency, and the frequency changes as light is redshifted, so the time difference between two crests is at the top is different from that at the bottom. The observer at the top sees a clock at the bottom running slowly. Hence the conclusion from Minkowski geometry, and SR in this case is wrong. The laboratory frame on Earth is not a Lorentz frame.

Frames that are inertial in a restricted sense do exist though:

*The Principle Of Equivalence*
- One important property of an inertial frame is that a particle at rest stays at rest if it experiences no forces. With other forces, it is possible to find a particle unaffected by the force field, but that's not the case with gravity. Hence, on earth, no particle could be a marker for an inertial frame (to find its trajectory, being unaffected by the gravitational field).
- However, the frame that falls freely is a frame where particles keep a uniform velocity, since the acceleration of the particles and the frame matches. Photons are not redshifted in this frame, so this scenario is the same as in SR. hence, this is a candidate for an inertial frame. Einstein hypothesized that such frames are inertial and built GR on it.
- Consider, in empty space free of gravity, an accelerating rocket ship. Things inside it would feel as if they are in a gravitational field, pointing towards the rear of the ship. Like gravity, the acceleration is independent of the internal composition and only dependent on the mass. A true inertial frame is one which falls freely towards the rear of the ship. Thus, uniform gravitational fields are equivalent to frames which accelerate uniformly relative to inertial frames This is the principle of equivalence between gravity and acceleration, and is a cornerstone of Einstein's gravity. This is the weak equivalence principle, weak because it only refers to gravity.
- The strong equivalence principle is that the behavior of all other forces of nature in a gravitational field can be discovered by postulating that their laws in a freely falling inertial frame are identical to their laws in SR, where there is no gravitational field.
- Before the proof that freely falling frames are inertial, note that the argument would hold only locally, far away where the gravitational field is different, an object would not move at uniform velocity in the freely falling frame that we had chosen. The second point is that there are an infinite number of freely falling frames, varying with velocity and orientation of their spatial axes, but the acceleration is the same.
